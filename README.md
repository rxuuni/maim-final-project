I attempted to open the link you provided, but I wasn't able to fetch the page's content. Could you please share a bit more detail about what's on that site (e.g., features, layout, functionality)? This will help me craft clear and useful documentation in English tailored to that application. Let me know a bit about:

The name of the app or what it does (e.g., event booking, dashboard, studio).

Key pages and features (e.g., login, event listing, checkout, admin panel).

User flows or main tasks someone would do on the site.

Any special technologies or frameworks you're using (e.g., React, Tailwind).

Once I have this info, Iâ€™ll draft a clean, organized documentation for you.
